# Q/A Forum

A simple question answer forum. Only a logged in user has access to create a question and answer any others. This project is totally based on concept of quora. Still some very basic features implemented though.

Only admin can create new tags from back end. When a user registers for an account he/she has choices for selecting any interested tags. So, in home page only questions of these tags would be shown otherwise all tags. Currently there is no option to edit existing selected tags. There is a profile page which shows thumbnail and username of a user.
